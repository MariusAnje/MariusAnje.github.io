The invention of the transistor was announced on December 16, 1947 by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs. However, the critical breakthrough occurred earlier on December 16, 1947, when they successfully demonstrated the first working point-contact transistor.

The invention was formally publicly announced on June 30, 1948 by Bell Labs.
